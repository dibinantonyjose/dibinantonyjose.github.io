        I’m a backend developer who loves working with JavaScript, TypeScript,
        and Node.js frameworks. Most of my time goes into building APIs, working
        with databases, and figuring out how to make systems more reliable and
        efficient. I like staying up to date with what’s happening in tech, and
        I enjoy going deep into concepts instead of just skimming the surface.

        Outside of work, I try to keep life active and balanced. I play football
        and badminton regularly, and cycling is something I really enjoy when I
        want to clear my head. Books and films are a big part of my downtime too
        — sometimes to learn something new, sometimes just to switch off.
      </p>

        I also like experimenting with side projects. They give me space to test
        ideas without pressure, and often that’s where I end up learning the
        most. For me, coding isn’t just about finishing tasks; it’s about
        constantly exploring better ways to do things and growing along the way.
